# Remediation Report

## Summary
Due to technical limitations, we were unable to directly apply some of the recommended changes. However, we have made progress in addressing the identified issues and have prepared recommendations for manual follow-up.

## Changes Made
1. Enhanced monitoring capabilities:
   - Created a new Terraform file (`monitoring.tf`) to set up CloudWatch alarms for S3 bucket changes.
   - Added an SNS topic for alerts.

2. Improved tagging strategy:
   - Updated the `main.tf` file to include more comprehensive tagging for resources.
   - Added `CreatedBy` and `LastUpdated` tags to the default tags.

## Manual Steps Required
1. Terraform State Verification:
   - Manually run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` in the `./terraform` directory.
   - Review the plan output to identify any discrepancies between the Terraform state and the actual infrastructure.

2. Enable Direct AWS Resource Querying:
   - Develop a script using AWS CLI or SDK to directly query resource configurations.
   - Compare the results with the Terraform state file.

3. Regular Audits:
   - Schedule quarterly manual audits of critical resources:
     a. CloudWatch Log Group: Review retention settings and log patterns.
     b. IAM Role: Audit permissions and trust relationships.
     c. S3 Bucket: Check bucket policies, encryption settings, and access logs.
     d. Security Group: Review inbound and outbound rules.

4. Monitoring Enhancement:
   - Verify that the CloudWatch alarm and SNS topic created in `monitoring.tf` are properly set up after applying the Terraform changes.
   - Set up CloudTrail to log all API calls for the account if not already done.
   - Configure additional CloudWatch alarms for critical changes to the monitored resources.

5. IaC Security Scanning:
   - Manually run Checkov or a similar IaC security scanning tool against the Terraform configurations.
   - Review and address any security issues identified by the scan.

6. Review Unmanaged Resources:
   - Investigate the S3 buckets not managed by Terraform:
     - aws-cloudtrail-logs-hkt
     - datmh-bedrock-kb
     - genifast-drift-logs
   - Determine if these buckets should be imported into Terraform management or excluded from drift detection.

## Next Steps
1. Apply the Terraform changes once the initialization issues are resolved.
2. Implement the manual steps outlined above.
3. Conduct a follow-up review to ensure all remediation steps have been completed successfully.
4. Establish a regular schedule for drift detection and remediation processes.

## Conclusion
While we encountered some technical limitations, we have made progress in addressing the drift detection findings. The manual steps outlined above will help ensure that the infrastructure remains in compliance with the defined configurations. Regular reviews and audits will be crucial in maintaining the integrity of the infrastructure going forward.
