# Terraform Drift Detection & Remediation System

A comprehensive multi-agent system that automatically detects, analyzes, and remediates Terraform infrastructure drift using AWS Bedrock-powered Claude 3.5 Sonnet agents, accessed through both a REST API and terminal-based chat interface.

## üöÄ System Overview

This system uses specialized AI agents to detect, analyze, and fix discrepancies between your Terraform configurations and actual cloud infrastructure. It provides both real-time detection and notification capabilities, supporting multi-user environments with isolated credentials and sessions.

### Agent Ecosystem

1. **OrchestrationAgent** (Central Coordinator)
   - Routes user requests to specialized agents
   - Coordinates the overall workflow
   - Manages system state and multi-agent interactions
   - Acts as the primary interface between user and specialized agents

2. **DetectAgent** (Drift Detection Specialist)
   - Parses Terraform state files
   - Queries actual AWS infrastructure
   - Identifies discrepancies between expected and actual state
   - Generates comprehensive drift detection reports

3. **DriftAnalyzerAgent** (Analysis & Assessment)
   - Analyzes severity and impact of detected drift
   - Categorizes drift types (security, performance, compliance)
   - Provides risk assessments
   - Recommends remediation strategies

4. **RemediateAgent** (Automated Remediation)
   - Generates corrected Terraform configurations
   - Creates/updates .tf files with proper configurations
   - Executes Terraform plans and applies changes
   - Validates successful remediation

5. **ReportAgent** (Reporting Specialist)
   - Generates structured JSON reports of drift findings
   - Formats analysis for human readability
   - Provides standardized output for integration with other systems
   - Creates session-specific reports with detailed drift information

6. **NotificationAgent** (Alerting & Monitoring)
   - Sets up AWS EventBridge and SNS notifications
   - Monitors real-time infrastructure changes
   - Sends email alerts on detected drift
   - Creates notification rules for proactive drift detection

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different aspects of drift management
- **API-First Design**: Complete REST API for integration with other systems
- **Session Isolation**: Supports multiple users with isolated sessions and credentials

## ü§ñ Example Usage

### Using the Chat Interface

```bash
üîß Terraform Drift System > detect drift in s3 buckets
ü§ñ OrchestrationAgent: Routing to DetectAgent to scan S3 resources...
ü§ñ DetectAgent: Scanning S3 buckets for drift...
‚úÖ Detected 2 drifted S3 buckets. Use 'analyze' for details.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Email Notifications

Set up real-time infrastructure change notifications:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/setup-notifications" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipient_emails": ["your-email@example.com"],
    "resource_types": ["AWS::S3::Bucket", "AWS::EC2::Instance"],
    "setup_aws_config": true
  }'
```

### Multi-User Support

The system supports multiple users with isolated sessions:

```bash
# User 1
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: session1" \
  -H "X-User-ID: user1" \
  -d '{"message": "detect drift"}'

# User 2
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: session2" \
  -H "X-User-ID: user2" \
  -d '{"message": "detect drift"}'
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- AWS credentials are stored in isolated memory spaces per session
- No permanent storage of credentials
- Each user gets isolated AWS sessions
- Supports temporary credentials via session tokens
- Permission-based access control for sensitive operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Credential Issues**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/test-aws-connection?user_id=your_user_id"
   ```

2. **Session Management**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/current-session-info"
   ```

3. **API Debugging**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/debug-boto3-sessions?session_id=your_session_id"
   ```
