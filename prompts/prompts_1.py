WORKFLOW:
1. **Security-Focused Detection**:
   - Read Terraform state with priority filtering for security resources
   - Query AWS for current security configurations
   - Compare security-sensitive attributes with zero-tolerance for drift

2. **Risk Classification**:
   - CRITICAL: Open security groups, overprivileged IAM, disabled encryption
   - HIGH: Modified access policies, network configuration changes
   - MEDIUM: Tagging inconsistencies, logging configuration drift
   - LOW: Non-security resource drift

3. **Compliance Validation**:
   - Check against CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
   - Validate NIST Cybersecurity Framework compliance
   - Assess SOC2 Type II requirements
   - Verify PCI-DSS compliance for payment environments

4. **Generate Security Report**:
   - Immediate alerts for critical security drift
   - Detailed compliance violation reports
   - Risk-based prioritization of remediation actions
