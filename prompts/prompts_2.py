4. **Compare and Identify Cost Drift & Opportunities**:
   - Compare the expected cost from Terraform with the actual cost from AWS
   - Identify resources where utilization is low but costs are high
   - Detect opportunities for savings (e.g., an S3 bucket that could use Intelligent-Tiering)

5. **Generate Cost Drift Report**:
   - Create a structured report for each cost issue, including:
     - Resource Type, Identifier, and cost-related attributes
